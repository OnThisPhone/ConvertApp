# ConvertApp
A simple interface for converting music/video with ffmpeg. Has a few advanced features as well.

Lets you convert common file formats with an easy-to-use interface.
You can make so that the app can be opened from the context menu in Windows too.

It should be noted that the language translations aren't completely finished. There may be some other bugs too. But should work without a problem.
